                    <p>We strongly encourage everyone to register to vote in advance if they can, as it will be easier to vote on election day if you do so. The deadline for advance registration is <strong>October 13th, 6pm Eastern.</strong> Let's go over the fundamentals so that you understand what's going on.</p>

                    <h2 class="center">Clarification: "Checking" vs. "Updating" vs. "Registering"</h2>
                    <p>These core concepts are poorly explained on the Elections Canada website. Let's examine each in turn:</p> 
                        
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Checking your Registration:</strong> If you voted in the last election, reside at the same address and haven't changed your name, then you're probably fine, and the service will simply confirm that you are registered to vote. </li>
                        <li><strong>Updating your Registration:</strong> In the case that you've moved, you should enter the address that you had when you last voted, <strong>not</strong> your current address. This will kickstart the registration update process. If you've changed your name, you also will need to update, but that will require a paper form.
                        <li><strong>Registering:</strong> If you have never voted before, you will have to register.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="col-sm-1"></div>

            <div class="row guide-row">

                <div class="col-sm-10">
                    <p>Registering online is the <strong>most convenient method</strong> of advance registration, <strong>but also has the highest chance of failure.</strong> There are multiple conditions that could stop you from checking, updating or registering online. Read through these first to save yourself the trouble of going through the process only to get confused and frustrated.</p>
                    <h3>Conditions that Could Stop your Online Registration Dead in its Tracks</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You've changed your name since you last voted.</li>
                        <li>You live abroad.</li>
                        <li>You're a member of the Canadian Forces.</li>
                        <li>You don't have the proper address type. It needs to be one of these three: civic (for example, 123 Main Street), <a href="#">lot and concession</a>, or <a href="#">Section-Township-Range-Meridian.</a></li>
                        <li>You don't have proper identification. This one is tricky, and deserves some attention:
                            <ul>
                                <li>In every province except for Quebec, your provincial driver's license is an acceptable form of online registration identification</li>
                                <li>In Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, Saskatchewan and Yukon, your provincial ID will also work</li>
                                <li><em>The identification must have your <strong>current address</strong></em></li>
                                <li><em>Therefore, if you live in Quebec (where neither the driver's license nor provincial ID are valid), or don't have the right ID for your province, you'll be ineligible to register online</em></li>
                            </ul>
                            
                        
                        </li>

                    <h2 class="center">Option 4: Vote at a Temporary Elections Canada Office in Advance</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>When:</strong> October 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th</li>
                        <li><strong>Where:</strong> Elections Canada is launching a <a href="http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=vot&dir=bkg&document=campu&lang=e">pilot project</a> to open offices at select campuses, Friendship Centres and community centres. You can find the full list <a href="http://www.elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=vote&dir=campus&document=index&lang=e">here.</a>
                        </li>     
                        <li>
                            <strong>How:</strong> This is pretty cool - any eligible voter can use one of these stations to vote, <strong>even if it's not in their riding.</strong> You vote by way of special ballot: votes will count in the riding where the voter's home address is located, <strong>not</strong> the riding that the temporary office is in. If you're living away from your riding, this is a great option.
                        </li>

                    <h2 class="center">Option 5: Vote by Mail</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>When:</strong> Apply by October 13th, 6pm Eastern (if you apply by mail or online), or 6pm local time (if you apply at your Elections Canada Office). Your completed ballot needs to reach Elections Canada by Election Day (October 19th).</li>
                        <li><strong>Where:</strong> Applications happen online, by mail, or at an Elections Canada Office.</a>
                        </li>     
                        <li>
                            <strong>How:</strong> In order to vote by mail, <a href="http://www.elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=vote&dir=svr&document=index&lang=e" target="_blank">you need to apply to do so.</a> You'll want get on that ASAP - they will mail you a voting kit, and you're going to have to mail it back before the Election happens. This way seems like the most annoying way to vote - but you might have to do it, if you can't access any of the other options.
