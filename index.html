                        <p>These core concepts are poorly explained on the Elections Canada website. Let's examine each in turn:</p> 

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Checking your Registration:</strong> If you voted in the last election, reside at the same address and haven't changed your name, then you're probably fine, and the service will simply confirm that you are registered to vote. </li>
                            <li><strong>Updating your Registration:</strong> In the case that you've moved, you should enter the address that you had when you last voted, <strong>not</strong> your current address. This will kickstart the registration update process. If you've changed your name, you also will need to update, but that will require a paper form.
                            <li><strong>Registering:</strong> If you have never voted before, you will have to register.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="col-sm-10">
                        <p>Registering online is the <strong>most convenient method</strong> of advance registration, <strong>but also has the highest chance of failure.</strong> There are multiple conditions that could stop you from checking, updating or registering online. Read through these first to save yourself the trouble of going through the process only to get confused and frustrated.</p>
                        <h3>Conditions that Could Stop your Online Registration Dead in its Tracks</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You've changed your name since you last voted.</li>

                            <li>You're a member of the Canadian Forces.</li>
                            <li>You don't have the proper address type. It needs to be one of these three: civic (for example, 123 Main Street), <a href="#">lot and concession</a>, or <a href="#">Section-Township-Range-Meridian.</a></li>
                            <li>You don't have proper identification. This one is tricky, and deserves some attention:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In every province except for Quebec, your provincial driver's license is an acceptable form of online registration identification</li>

                        <p>As mentioned at the top of the page, the Fair Elections Act has changed the requirements surrounding voter identification, <strong>enforcing new, more stringent rules about proving your address.</strong> These rules motivated the creation of this guide - they could very easily stop you from voting at all. So, listen up!</p> -->

                                <strong>1-Piece:</strong> If you have a driver's license, provinicial or territorial ID card, or any other government card with your photo, name and <strong>current address</strong>, then you're golden. You only need this <strong>one</strong> piece of ID. Of course, the hard part for many people is the fact that their ID doesn't reflect their current address.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="guide-p"><strong>2-Piece:</strong> Elections Canada provides a <a href="http://www.elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=id&document=index&lang=e">very long-winded list</a> of the 39 types of identification that it accepts as one of two pieces of ID. What it doesn't emphasize, however, are the <strong>common pieces that are likely to contain your current address.</strong> Here they are:</p>

                                <ul class="guide-ul">
                                    <li>Residential lease or sub-lease</li>
                                    <li>Utility bill listing your name and address (e.g. Internet; electricity; water; telephone, cable or satellite). Don't have a printer? You can show them an e-statement. <strong>The fact that you can use an electronic statement is not listed on Elections Canada's website, but we called them and they told us that it's possible.</strong></li>
                                    <li>Letter of confirmation of residence signed by the residence administrator from your student residence</li>
                                    <li>Letter of confirmation of residence from a First Nations band or reserve or an Inuit local authority</li>

                                    <li>Credit card statement</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>We won't provide the rest of the list here - check out the <a href="http://www.elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=id&document=index&lang=e">official list from Elections Canada.</a> Note that the voter identification card, <strong>despite the fact that Elections Canada itself mails it to you,</strong> and that it contains your address, is no longer accepted as a valid proof of identity.</p>

                            <li>
                                <p class="guide-p"><strong>Vouching:</strong> This is another major aspect of voter identification that the Fair Elections Act messed with. In the past, one person could vouch for the identities of an unlimited number of others. Now, you can only vouch for <strong>one other person.</strong> This really weakens the ability of vouching - but, if you can't come up with identification one of the above methods, you could still bring a friend and make your vote count.</p>

                                <p>From the <a href="http://www.elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=id&document=index&lang=e">Elections Canada site</a>: If your ID does not have your current address, take an oath. Show two pieces of ID with your name and have someone who knows you attest to your address. This person must show proof of identity and address, be registered in the same polling division, and attest for only one person.</p>
